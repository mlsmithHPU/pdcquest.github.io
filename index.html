    <h2>PDC Quest Card Game</h2>
  <p><strong>PDC Quest</strong> is a card game that includes 80 cards (questions) based on the eight PDC (Parallel and Distributed Computing) concept categories. Each card is numbered and coded according to its category, with each category having a unique number (1–8) and a two-letter abbreviation.</p>
<br>
  <h2>PDC Concept Categories</h2>

  <p>Each category includes ten cards, resulting in a total of 80 cards. PDC Quest can be played after covering one or more PDC concept categories in class, making it a great review activity before quizzes or exams. It also serves as an engaging way to evaluate students’ grasp of PDC concepts.
The game is designed for groups of three players, but it can be easily modified to accommodate larger groups.
    <br>
<h2>PDC Quest Game Rules</h2>
<!--    <p>Before the game begins, the category or categories of cards to be reviewed should be pulled from the main deck and placed in the Deal stack. Ensure that the Deal stack is thoroughly shuffled. 
    To begin the game, Player 1 selects a card from the Deal stack and passes it to Player 2. Player 2 reads the question aloud, waiting for Player 1 to answer. Player 1 has 60 seconds to provide an answer. Upon Player 1 answering the question, Players 2 and 3 evaluate and rate the answer given by Player 1 by assigning a score of 0 for no answer or incorrect answer, 1 for a partially correct answer, and a score of 2 for a complete and correct answer. The evaluation process could involve examining a more comprehensive description of the subject matter via the QR code, prompting a discussion among the players, and contributing to their learning experience. The score for Player 1 should be recorded on the scoresheet, and the card is placed in another stack called the Played stack.</p>
    <p>The game continues as Player 2 draws from the Deal stack and gives the card to Player 3 to read aloud, and Player 2 answers the question. Players 1 and 3 evaluate the answer, assign a score by documenting it on the scoresheet, and place the card played in the Played stack. The game continues in this manner until no more cards are left in the Deal stack. The scoresheet is kept, which indicates the players' names, categories, and scores received. An example of the scoresheet is shown in Figure 1. At the end of the game, players average their scores from each category by taking the total score from each category and dividing it by the number of cards played in that category. The scoresheet can act as a gauge of revealing which categories the player needs to study more.
</p>-->
    <h4>Set Up</h4>
    <ul>
      <li>Before starting, select the category (or categories) of cards to be reviewed.</li>
      <li>Place these cards into the <strong>Deal stack</strong> and shuffle thoroughly.</li>
    </ul>
  

    <h4>Taking Turns</h4>
    <ul>
      <li><strong>Player 1</strong> draws the top card from the Deal stack and passes it to <strong>Player 2</strong>.</li>
      <li><strong>Player 2</strong> reads the question aloud while <strong>Player 1</strong> has <strong>60 seconds</strong> to answer.</li>
    </ul>
  
    <h4>Scoring</h4>
    <ul>
      <li>After Player 1 responds, Players 2 and 3 evaluate the answer and assign a score:</li>
      <ul class="sublist">
        <li><strong>0</strong> = no answer or incorrect</li>
        <li><strong>1</strong> = partially correct</li>
        <li><strong>2</strong> = fully correct</li>
      </ul>
      <li>Players may consult the QR code for more details, discuss the topic, and use the conversation as part of the learning process.</li>
      <li>Record Player 1’s score on the scoresheet, then place the card in the <strong>Played stack</strong>.</li>
    </ul>
 
     <h4>Continuing Play</h4>
    <ul>
      <li>Player 2 draws a card and passes it to Player 3, who reads the question aloud.</li>
      <li>Player 2 answers; Players 1 and 3 evaluate and score the response.</li>
      <li>Continue in rotation until the Deal stack is empty.</li>
    </ul>
  
    <h4>Recording Results</h4>
    <ul>
      <li>The scoresheet should include each player's name, the categories reviewed, and the scores earned.</li>
      <li>At the end of the game, calculate each player's <strong>average score per category</strong>:</li>
    </ul>

         Average = Total Score in Category ÷ Number of Cards Played in Category
    

    <p> Use the score sheet to identify which categories require further review.

You can print the cards double-sided, but you will need to cut them out manually. The ZIP file contains image files of the card fronts and backs, which can be used in playing card software or customized to create cards in different sizes.</p>
