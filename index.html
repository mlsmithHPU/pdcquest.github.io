<h2>PDC Quest Game Rules</h2>
    <p>Before the game begins, the category or categories of cards to be reviewed should be pulled from the main deck and placed in the Deal stack. Ensure that the Deal stack is thoroughly shuffled. To begin the game, Player 1 selects a card from the Deal stack and passes it to Player 2. Player 2 reads the question aloud, waiting for Player 1 to answer. Player 1 has 60 seconds to provide an answer. Upon Player 1 answering the question, Players 2 and 3 evaluate and rate the answer given by Player 1 by assigning a score of 0 for no answer or incorrect answer, 1 for a partially correct answer, and a score of 2 for a complete and correct answer. The evaluation process could involve examining a more comprehensive description of the subject matter via the QR code, prompting a discussion among the players and contributing to their learning experience. The score for Player 1 should be recorded on the scoresheet, and the card is placed in another stack called the Played stack.
The game continues as Player 2 draws from the Deal stack and gives the card to Player 3 to read aloud, and Player 2 answers the question. Players 1 and 3 evaluate the answer, assign a score by documenting it on the scoresheet, and place the card played in the Played stack. The game continues in this manner until no more cards are left in the Deal stack. The scoresheet is kept, which indicates the players' names, categories, and scores received. An example of the scoresheet is shown in Figure 1. At the end of the game, players average their scores from each category by taking the total score from each category and dividing it by the number of cards played in that category. The scoresheet can act as a gauge of revealing what categories the player needs to study more.
